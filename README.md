QWaccent layout aims to minimize the use of dead keys when writing French diacritics (é,à,û,ï...).   
It also tries to be as easy to use as possible, by sometimes choosing **efficiency over consistency**: the [most often used diacritics](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9quence_d%27apparition_des_lettres_en_fran%C3%A7ais) are placed on their corresponding letter key.  

For instance (note the different accents):  
- `AltGr` + `e` = `é`
- `AltGr` + `a` = `à`
- `AltGr` + `u` = `û`

Other diacritics are placed on adjacent letters.

Consistency is preserved for dead keys though. If you forget a shortcut, you can still write your diacritic using them, as there are easy to remember (they are the same as the default UK Extended layout).

For instance:
- `AltGr` + `` ´ `` , `e` = `é`
- `AltGr` + `` ` `` , `a` = `à`
- `AltGr` + `` ^ `` , `u` = `û`
